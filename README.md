### Fly Swatter

The objective is to kill the fly before it touches the cake at the bottom of the screen.

### How to play

Click on the fly to make is disappear. Once you have completed the object you will be given the option to play again only this time you will have kill two flies.

### Unrevolved issues

- The game is currently missing the GameOver condition when the fly comes in contact with the cake.

- I keep getting an error on line 77 in the js file.

- If you expand the window, the fly will wander off the blue background, it's reccomended to adjust the window size to 600 x 600.
